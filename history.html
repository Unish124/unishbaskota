                    <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>My name is Unish Baskota, and I was born in Nepal. I am currently studying in grade 10. From a young age, I developed a passion for technology, science, and computers. I have always been curious about how things work and love learning new ways to solve problems using technology. This curiosity has driven me to work on various projects to enhance my knowledge and skills.</p>

                    <h3>Current Project</h3>
                    <p>One of my ongoing projects is a GPA calculator. I am building it to help students easily calculate their Grade Point Average based on their marks. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing students to input their marks and instantly get their GPA. This project has helped me deepen my understanding of programming, logic, and mathematical formulas, and I am continuously working to improve and expand its functionality.</p>
